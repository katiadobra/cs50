1. check if arguments are correct:
    if more than 1 argument -> false
    if not a number -> false
    if it's <= 0 -> false
    so - print the message "Usage: ./caesar key"
2. convert argument to a digit (atoi => convert a string into a number)
3. prompt a text from user
4. check the text
5. iterate over each character of the text
    if it's a letter from 'A' to 'Z'
    if it's from 'a' to 'z'
    if it's a digit or not an alphabetic - leave it unchanged
    (
        isalpha
        is
    )

    5.1 convert character to a number (for example: 'H' = 72)
6. change every character (exept digits) with user's key (72 + 1)
7. save this text in a variable
8. return text - output "ciphertext:"
9. return empty string - output "\n"

Formula for converting text
Ci = (Pi + k) % 26
i-th character of ciphertext

convert ASCII to alpha index
